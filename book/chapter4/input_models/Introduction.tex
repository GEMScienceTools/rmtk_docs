The following sections describe the parameters and file formats for the input models required for the various methodologies of the vulnerability module, including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Capacity curves
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Base shear vs. roof displacement
  	\item Base shear vs. floor displacements
  	\item Spectral acceleration vs. spectral displacement
  \end{itemize}
  \item Ground motion records
  \item Damage models
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Strain-based damage criterion
  	\item Capacity curve-based damage criterion
  	\item Inter-storey drift-based damage criterion
  \end{itemize}
  \item Consequence models
\end{itemize}

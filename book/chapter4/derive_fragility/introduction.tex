This section explains how a probability damage matrix (\verb=PDM=) can be used to derive a fragility function (i.e. probability of exceedance of a number of
damage states for a set of intensity measure levels), and then converted into a vulnerability function  (i.e. distribution of loss ratio for a set of intensity measure levels), using a consequence model (see Section \ref{subsec:cons_model}). Both of these models can be exported in the OpenQuake-engine format (\verb=nrml=), or following a \verb=csv= format. Additional intructions about the necessary input models and associated formats can be found on the OpenQuake-engine User Guide \citep{GEM2015}.\\

Several structural analysis packages allow the user to perform a reliable pushover analysis on a nonlinear model of the MDOF structure. Often, these MDOF pushover cuves need to be converted to simplified SDOF models for use in nonlinear static analysis methods. This module allows the conversion of the MDOF results into 'equivalent SDOF' results, thus making them compatible with a wide range of non-linear static procedures. At present, two methods are provided in this module for obtaining equivalent SDOF capacity curves for an MDOF system.

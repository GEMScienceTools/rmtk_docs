This method allows the user to convert a pushover curve for an MDOF system into an equivalent SDOF capacity curve, considering the first mode of vibration only. The supplied pushover curve, which is in terms of base shear and roof displacement, is transformed into an equivalent SDOF capacity curve, which is in terms of spectral acceleration and spectral displacement.

The \textit{rmtk} is currently subdivided into two classes of tools, the Vulnerability and Plotting tools, presented in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of this tutorial respectively. In the Vulnerability chapter the vulnerability methodologies implemented are classified in Non-linear Static (NLS) and Non-linear Dynamic (NLD) according to the structural analysis type performed to assess the response of the building. These two main sections (NLS and NLD) are organised as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item General Introduction.
\item Getting Started, where it is explained what files need to be executed to start the vulnerability analysis, and what options are available to call the preferred methodology and to input the preferred data type.
\item Description of the methodologies.
\end{itemize}

Within the description of each methodology the user can find the following subsections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Theoretical description of the method.
\item Description and examples of the inputs.
\item Description of the workflow.
\end{itemize}

A summary of the algorithms available in the present version is given in Table \ref{tab:current_features}.

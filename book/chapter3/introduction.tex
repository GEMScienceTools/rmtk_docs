The OpenQuake-engine currently generates the most commonly used seismic hazard and risk results (e.g. hazard maps, loss curves, average annual losses). However, it is recognized that there are a number of other risk metrics that might not be of interest of the general GEM community, but fundamental for specific users. This module of the Risk Modeller's Toolkit aims to provide users with additional risk results and functionalities, based on the standard output of the OpenQuake-engine.

The OpenQuake-engine currently generates the most common seismic hazard and risk results (e.g. hazard maps, loss curves, average annual losses). However, it is recognized that there are a number of other metrics that might not be of interest of the general GEM community, but fundamental for specific users. This module of the Risk Modeller's Toolkit aims to provide users with additional risk results and functionalities.
